 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a math explainer website. The website should provide explanations of mathematical concepts in a clear and concise way. The website should also be easy to navigate and use.

## Design

The website will be built using the Flask framework. Flask is a Python microframework that is well-suited for building simple websites. The website will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the website.
* `about.html`: A page about the website and its authors.
* `contact.html`: A page with contact information for the website authors.
* `math_explanations.html`: A page that lists all of the mathematical concepts that are explained on the website.
* `math_explanation.html`: A page that provides an explanation of a single mathematical concept.

The website will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/about`: The about page.
* `/contact`: The contact page.
* `/math_explanations`: The page that lists all of the mathematical concepts that are explained on the website.
* `/math_explanation/<concept>`: The page that provides an explanation of a single mathematical concept.

## Implementation

The website can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Install Flask and the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a new Flask application.
3. Create the HTML files for the website.
4. Create the routes for the website.
5. Test the website to make sure it works correctly.
6. Deploy the website to a production server.
